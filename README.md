<h3>AR in Shibuya, Tokyo</h3>

AR-Shibuya is based off of this documentation:
https://developers.google.com/ar/develop/java/sceneform/import-assets

I imported the art assets (single .obj file, no texture) into the sceneform sample project using the sceneform android plugin.

Dependencies: 
- Android SDK
- Sceneform android plugin
